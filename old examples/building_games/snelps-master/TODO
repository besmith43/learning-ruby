 - palms draw their trunks in the wrong square
 - get campaign working w/o external server running
 - get player slot registration working
   - build multiplayer map

"move units here" campaign

 - rubygoo integration
   - model updates should not be triggered via gui updates
   - remove drawable component, as it is not a behavior but a need of the system
   - remove all GooEvents/drawing knowledge from "models"

 - morphing abilities
   - should attack entities (auto-morph/unmorph) actually live on the occupancy grid? or should they transcend it?
   - unit creation should pass along any target info it has
   - melee_attack/move/etc should respect :auto_melee_attack: true

 - change gatherer/collector to keep track of which resource is held/deposited
 - change mouse hover to show if something is targetable/attackable

 - add images to story stacks, with ken burns effect (pan/zoom)

"gameplay"
 - add structures (basic unit creation) (larger than one tile)
 - add structure placement "grid-locking"
 - move music to map definition

MULTIPLAYER
 - add simple intro UI (map selection)
 - how to fire off external server for multiplayer? (separate ruby call?  ruby server.rb? )

PROBLEMS
 - dragging on minimap shouldn't show selection box
 - every movable entity should have its own Pathfinder (where should it get it?)
   - or the same Pathfinder that we can pass in something to lookup map/unit occupancy

BACKLOG
 - add logger to app
 - clean up and add docs EVERYWHERE
