Welcome to a new land reaper. Here, you will face a bigger threat, as a group of enemy archers were spotted &
on their way here, along with a few warriors.

To dispose of them, i'll show you a new and exciting addition to our army. &
Do you see that new minion on your land? That's a zombie.
Zombies are slower but stronger than skeletons, a combination of both could be deadly.
>Message Summon
Summon two zombies to start.

(Enter summoning mode (S) and press number 2 (you can swap between units with number keys (1,2,3...))
>Message Enemies
Enemies are almost here. Prepare yourself and show them the meaning of fear.
>Message Archers
An archer is about to arrive with a warrior at his side. Archers are deadly ranged units, however, killing a skeleton &
with an arrow is a hard task. Try to summon extra skeletons when dealing with them.
>Message More
There are three enemy waves remaining master. Take a portion of my energy and destroy each one of them.

(Wait for waves to begin spawning before summoning units (so you can identify the enemy army weakness and take advantage of it))
(You can slow time by pressing the spacebar (and pressing it again would bring time back to normal))
>Message Last
The last group of enemies is about to arrive.
(Try slowing time (spacebar) and order your units in a formation (to avoid units colliding))
>Message Victory
This land is now ours. I'll be experimenting with the blood of our fallen enemies. I'll be back soon.
