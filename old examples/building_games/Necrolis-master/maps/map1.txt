Awake reaper, the dark council begs for your help, so show us your true power.

This land, Imperius, is ruled by the living. Their armies are large and strong, but your power is far beyond their &
limits.

I'll help you unlock your dormant power, and once it's done, we shall make each of them, bend to their knees, and obey &
your will.

>Message Base
Look at the northwest. Do you see the graves on the ground?. That's our base, and only inside it, you'll be able to &
summon your minions.

Enemies will try to reach your base, stay alert, because enemies inside your domains will slowly drain your energy. &
The best idea, is to slaughter them all before they get inside.
--
>Message Summon
It's time for you to learn how to summon minions.

The summoning mode allows you to create all type of undead creatures at your orders, but you can only do it inside your &
base. Summoning units costs energy, and corpses, both of them, are gained by killing enemies, (you can see your current energy &
and corpses at the top of the screen)

Start by summoning 1 skeleton, press the S key to enter the summoning mode, and left click the point where you want to summon &
the unit.
>Message Orders
After summoning a unit, it'll be ready to serve you (a white rectangle around a unit indicates it is currently selected)

Exit the summoning mode with S, and order your unit to walk around the land (by pressing the right mouse button)

(If you left click anywhere on the land, the unit will no longer listen to your orders, however, you can control it back again &
by clicking it with the left mouse button.)

>Message MoreSummoning
Enemies are on their way to our base, but a single skeleton is no match for the enemy warriors.
I'll give you enough energy and corpses to summon 2 more skeleton.

(If you drag the left mouse button in summoning mode you'll be able to create multiple units)
(If you drag the left mouse button outside summoning mode you'll be able to select multiple units)
--
>Message Enemies
Now you have 3 skeletons to battle the enemy forces.
Exit the summoning mode (S) and select the three of them (keep left click pressed and drag the mouse).

Wait for the enemy to appear, and order them to attack (order them to move to the enemies position)
(Units will fight automatically once they're close enough to an enemy unit)&
>Message AlmostOver
You were able to defeat the enemy warriors, but two of them are still on their way.
With the energy and corpses you've gathered from the killed enemies, summon new skeletons and prepare for the final battle.

(Press S to enter/exit summoning mode)
(Skeletons cost 15 energy and 1 corpse)&
>Message FinalBattle
The enemies have arrived, select your skeletons and form them in a line to fight.

(Left click+drag = Select)
(Right click = Move)&
>Message Victory
CONGRATULATIONS. YOU HAVE CONQUERED THIS LAND.
