Reaper, stay alert, a group of soldiers have stablished an output at this region, and many patrols are around the area.
We have to be quick, get rid of as many soldiers as we can, and then, repel the enemy reinforcements.
>Message Ready
Take all of my energy, and use the corpses i've been preparing at your will.
Start attacking the lone soldiers, and then, proceed to defeat the groups.

I'll need a moment to to show you something i've been preparing, don't worry, i'll come back soon.
>Message Spell
I'm back again, reaper, and this time, to show you how to cast spells.

Spells cost energy, but they are really useful in battle.
I've only been able to research one spell, but it will be more than enough for now. Finger of death &
is able to instantly kill a simple living unit, however, you won't gain energy nor corpses.

(To cast spells enter the casting mode ('C' key)) (Spells can be casted anywhere, but the cost is reduced to half if casted &
on your territory)
>Message Waves
The enemy patrols are incoming, both from the east and north, prepare yourself for the fight.

(Finding the right combination of units and spells is the key to victory)
>Message Victory
The ground is now filed with dead bodies. Congratulations.
