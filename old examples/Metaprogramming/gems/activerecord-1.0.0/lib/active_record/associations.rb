    # Associations are a set of macro-like class methods for tying objects together through foreign keys. They express relationships like 
    # "Project has one Project Manager" or "Project belongs to a Portfolio". Each macro adds a number of methods to the class which are 
    # specialized according to the collection or association symbol and the options hash. It works much the same was as Ruby's own attr* 
    # methods. Example:
    #
    #   class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     belongs_to              :portfolio
    #     has_one                 :project_manager 
    #     has_many                :milestones
    #     has_and_belongs_to_many :categories
    #   end
    #
    # The project class now has the following methods to ease the traversel and manipulation of its relationships:
    # * <tt>Project#portfolio, Project#portfolio=(portfolio), Project#portfolio.nil?, Project#portfolio?(portfolio)</tt>
    # * <tt>Project#project_manager, Project#project_manager=(project_manager), Project#project_manger.nil?,</tt>
    #   <tt>Project#project_manager?(project_manager), Project#build_project_manager, Project#create_project_manager</tt>
    # * <tt>Project#milestones.empty?, Project#milestones.size, Project#milestones, Project#milestones<<(milestone),</tt>
    #   <tt>Project#milestones.delete(milestone), Project#milestones.find(milestone_id), Project#milestones.find_all(conditions),</tt>
    #   <tt>Project#milestones.build, Project#milestones.create</tt>
    # * <tt>Project#categories.empty?, Project#categories.size, Project#categories, Project#categories<<(category1),</tt>
    #   <tt>Project#categories.delete(category1)</tt>
    #
    # == Example
    #
    # link:../examples/associations.png
    #
    # == Is it belongs_to or has_one?
    #
    # Both express a 1-1 relationship, the difference is mostly where to place the foreign key, which goes on the table for the class
    # saying belongs_to. Example:
    #
    #   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_one :author
    #   end
    #
    #   class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     belongs_to :post
    #   end
    #
    # The tables for these classes could look something like:
    #
    #   CREATE TABLE posts (
    #     id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
    #     title varchar default NULL,
    #     PRIMARY KEY  (id)
    #   )
    #
    #   CREATE TABLE authors (
    #     id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
    #     post_id int(11) default NULL,
    #     name varchar default NULL,
    #     PRIMARY KEY  (id)
    #   )
    #
    # == Caching
    #
    # All of the methods are built on a simple caching principle that will keep the result of the last query around unless specifically
    # instructed not to. The cache is even shared across methods to make it even cheaper to use the macro-added methods without 
    # worrying too much about performance at the first go. Example:
    #
    #   project.milestones             # fetches milestones from the database
    #   project.milestones.size        # uses the milestone cache
    #   project.milestones.empty?      # uses the milestone cache
    #   project.milestones(true).size  # fetches milestones from the database
    #   project.milestones             # uses the milestone cache
    #
    # == Modules
    #
    # By default, associations will look for objects within the current module scope. Consider:
    #
    #   module MyApplication
    #     module Business
    #       class Firm < ActiveRecord::Base
    #          has_many :clients
    #        end
    #
    #       class Company < ActiveRecord::Base; end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # When Firm#clients is called, it'll in turn call <tt>MyApplication::Business::Company.find(firm.id)</tt>. If you want to associate
    # with a class in another module scope this can be done by specifying the complete class name, such as:
    #
    #   module MyApplication
    #     module Business
    #       class Firm < ActiveRecord::Base; end
    #     end
    #
    #     module Billing
    #       class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
    #         belongs_to :firm, :class_name => "MyApplication::Business::Firm"
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # == Type safety with ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch
    #
    # If you attempt to assign an object to an association that doesn't match the inferred or specified <tt>:class_name</tt>, you'll
    # get a ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch.
    #
    # == Options
    #
    # All of the association macros can be specialized through options which makes more complex cases than the simple and guessable ones
    # possible.
    module ClassMethods
      # Adds the following methods for retrival and query of collections of associated objects.
      # +collection+ is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument, so 
      # <tt>has_many :clients</tt> would add among others <tt>has_clients?</tt>.
      # * <tt>collection(force_reload = false)</tt> - returns an array of all the associated objects.
      #   An empty array is returned if none is found.
      # * <tt>collection<<(object)</tt> - adds the object to the collection (by setting the foreign key on it) and saves it.
      # * <tt>collection.delete(object)</tt> - removes the association by setting the foreign key to null on the associated object.
      # * <tt>!collection.empty?</tt> - returns true if there's any associated objects.
      # * <tt>collection.size</tt> - returns the number of associated objects.
      # * <tt>collection.find(id)</tt> - finds an associated object responding to the +id+ and that
      #   meets the condition that it has to be associated with this object.
      # * <tt>collection.find_all(conditions = nil, orderings = nil, limit = nil, joins = nil)</tt> - finds all associated objects responding 
      #   criterias mentioned (like in the standard find_all) and that meets the condition that it has to be associated with this object.
      # * <tt>collection.build(attributes = {})</tt> - returns a new object of the collection type that has been instantiated
      #   with +attributes+ and linked to this object through a foreign key but has not yet been saved.
      # * <tt>collection.create(attributes = {})</tt> - returns a new object of the collection type that has been instantiated
      #   with +attributes+ and linked to this object through a foreign key and that has already been saved (if it passed the validation).
      #
      # Example: A Firm class declares <tt>has_many :clients</tt>, which will add:
      # * <tt>Firm#clients</tt> (similar to <tt>Clients.find_all "firm_id = #{id}"</tt>)
      # * <tt>Firm#clients<<</tt>
      # * <tt>Firm#clients.delete</tt>
      # * <tt>!Firm#clients.empty?</tt> (similar to <tt>firm.clients.length > 0</tt>)
      # * <tt>Firm#clients.size</tt> (similar to <tt>Client.count "firm_id = #{id}"</tt>)
      # * <tt>Firm#clients.find</tt> (similar to <tt>Client.find_on_conditions(id, "firm_id = #{id}")</tt>)
      # * <tt>Firm#clients.find_all</tt> (similar to <tt>Client.find_all "firm_id = #{id}"</tt>)
      # * <tt>Firm#clients.build</tt> (similar to <tt>Client.new("firm_id" => id)</tt>)
      # * <tt>Firm#clients.create</tt> (similar to <tt>c = Client.new("client_id" => id); c.save; c</tt>)
      # The declaration can also include an options hash to specialize the generated methods.
      # 
      # Options are:
      # * <tt>:class_name</tt>  - specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be infered
      #   from the association name. So <tt>has_many :products</tt> will by default be linked to the +Product+ class, but
      #   if the real class name is +SpecialProduct+, you'll have to specify it with this option.
      # * <tt>:conditions</tt>  - specify the conditions that the associated objects must meet in order to be included as a "WHERE"
      #   sql fragment, such as "price > 5 AND name LIKE 'B%'".
      # * <tt>:order</tt>       - specify the order in which the associated objects are returned as a "ORDER BY" sql fragment,
      #   such as "last_name, first_name DESC"
      # * <tt>:foreign_key</tt> - specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name
      #   of this class in lower-case and "_id" suffixed. So a +Person+ class that makes a has_many association will use "person_id"
      #   as the default foreign_key.
      # * <tt>:dependent</tt>   - if set to true all the associated object are destroyed alongside this object
      # * <tt>:exclusively_dependent</tt>   - if set to true all the associated object are deleted in one SQL statement without having their
      #   before_destroy callback run. This should only be used on associations that depend solely on this class and don't need to do any
      #   clean-up in before_destroy. The upside is that it's much faster, especially if there's a counter_cache involved.
      # * <tt>:finder_sql</tt>  - specify a complete SQL statement to fetch the association. This is a good way to go for complex
      #   associations that depends on multiple tables. Note: When this option is used, +find_in_collection+ is _not_ added.
      #
      # Option examples:
      #   has_many :comments, :order => "posted_on"
      #   has_many :people, :class_name => "Person", :conditions => "deleted = 0", :order => "name"
      #   has_many :tracks, :order => "position", :dependent => true
      #   has_many :subscribers, :class_name => "Person", :finder_sql =>
      #       'SELECT DISTINCT people.* ' +
      #       'FROM people p, post_subscriptions ps ' +
      #       'WHERE ps.post_id = #{id} AND ps.person_id = p.id ' +

      # * <tt>collection<<(object)</tt> - adds an association between this object and the object given as argument. Multiple associations
      #   can be created by passing an array of objects instead.
      # * <tt>collection.delete(object)</tt> - removes the association between this object and the object given as 
      #   argument. Multiple associations can be removed by passing an array of objects instead.

      # Example: An Developer class declares <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many :projects</tt>, which will add:
      # * <tt>Developer#projects</tt>
      # * <tt>!Developer#projects.empty?</tt>
      # * <tt>Developer#projects.size</tt>
      # * <tt>Developer#projects<<</tt>
      # * <tt>Developer#projects.delete</tt>
      # The declaration can also include an options hash to specialize the generated methods.
      # 
      # Options are:
      # * <tt>:class_name</tt> - specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be infered
      #   from the association name. So <tt>has_and_belongs_to_many :projects</tt> will by default be linked to the 
      #   +Project+ class, but if the real class name is +SuperProject+, you'll have to specify it with this option.
      # * <tt>:join_table</tt> - specify the name of the join table if the default based on lexical order isn't what you want.
      #   WARNING: If you're overwriting the table name of either class, the table_name method MUST be declared underneath any
      #   has_and_belongs_to_many declaration in order to work.
      # * <tt>:foreign_key</tt> - specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name
      #   of this class in lower-case and "_id" suffixed. So a +Person+ class that makes a has_and_belongs_to_many association
      #   will use "person_id" as the default foreign_key.
      # * <tt>:association_foreign_key</tt> - specify the association foreign key used for the association. By default this is
      #   guessed to be the name of the associated class in lower-case and "_id" suffixed. So the associated class is +Project+
      #   that makes a has_and_belongs_to_many association will use "project_id" as the default association foreign_key.
      # * <tt>:order</tt> - specify the order in which the associated objects are returned as a "ORDER BY" sql fragment, such as "last_name, first_name DESC".
      # * <tt>:finder_sql</tt> - overwrite the default generated SQL used to fetch the association with a manual one
      # * <tt>:delete_sql</tt> - overwrite the default generated SQL used to remove links between the associated 
      #   classes with a manual one
      # * <tt>:insert_sql</tt> - overwrite the default generated SQL used to add links between the associated classes
      #   with a manual one
      #
      # Option examples:
      #   has_and_belongs_to_many :projects
      #   has_and_belongs_to_many :nations, :class_name => "Country"
      #   has_and_belongs_to_many :categories, :join_table => "prods_cats"
