# Allows attributes to be shared within an inheritance hierarchy, but where each descentent gets a copy of
# their parents' attributes, instead of just a pointer to the same. This means that the child can add elements
# to, for example, an array without those additions being shared with either their parent, siblings, or
# children, which is unlike the regular class-level attributes that are shared across the entire hierarchy.
