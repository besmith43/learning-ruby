module Rack

  # The Rack::Static middleware intercepts requests for static files
  # (javascript files, images, stylesheets, etc) based on the url prefixes
  # passed in the options, and serves them using a Rack::File object. This
  # allows a Rack stack to serve both static and dynamic content.
  #
  # Examples:
  #     use Rack::Static, :urls => ["/media"]
  #     will serve all requests beginning with /media from the "media" folder
  #     located in the current directory (ie media/*).
  #
  #     use Rack::Static, :urls => ["/css", "/images"], :root => "public"
  #     will serve all requests beginning with /css or /images from the folder
  #     "public" in the current directory (ie public/css/* and public/images/*)
