# Associations are used in order to specify relationships between model classes
# that reflect relations between tables in the database using foreign keys.
#
# Each kind of association adds a number of methods to the model class which
# are specialized according to the association type and optional parameters
# given in the definition. Example:
# 
#   class Project < Sequel::Model
#     many_to_one :portfolio
#     one_to_many :milestones
#   end
# 
# The project class now has the following methods:
# * Project#portfolio, Project#portfolio=
# * Project#milestones, Project#add_milestone, Project#remove_milestone,
#   Project#milestones_dataset
#
# By default the classes for the associations are inferred from the association
# name, so for example the Project#portfolio will return an instance of 
# Portfolio, and Project#milestones will return an array of Milestone 
# instances, in similar fashion to how ActiveRecord infers class names.
#
# Association definitions are also reflected by the class, e.g.:
#
#   >> Project.associations
#   => [:portfolio, :milestones]
#   >> Project.association_reflection(:portfolio)
#   => {:type => :many_to_one, :name => :portfolio, :class_name => "Portfolio"}
#
# Associations can be defined by either using the associate method, or by
# calling one of the three methods: many_to_one, one_to_many, many_to_many.
# Sequel::Model also provides aliases for these methods that conform to
# ActiveRecord conventions: belongs_to, has_many, has_and_belongs_to_many.
# For example, the following three statements are equivalent:
#
#   associate :one_to_many, :attributes
#   one_to_many :attributes
#   has_many :attributes
module Sequel::Model::Associations
  # Array of all association reflections
  def all_association_reflections
    association_reflections.values
  end
  
  # Associates a related model with the current model. The following types are
  # supported:
  #
  # * :many_to_one - Foreign key in current model's table points to 
  #   associated model's primary key.  Each associated model object can
  #   be associated with more than one current model objects.  Each current
  #   model object can be associated with only one associated model object.
  #   Similar to ActiveRecord/DataMapper's belongs_to.
  # * :one_to_many - Foreign key in associated model's table points to this
  #   model's primary key.   Each current model object can be associated with
  #   more than one associated model objects.  Each associated model object
  #   can be associated with only one current model object.
  #   Similar to ActiveRecord/DataMapper's has_many.
  # * :many_to_many - A join table is used that has a foreign key that points
  #   to this model's primary key and a foreign key that points to the
  #   associated model's primary key.  Each current model object can be
  #   associated with many associated model objects, and each associated
  #   model object can be associated with many current model objects.
  #   Similar to ActiveRecord/DataMapper's has_and_belongs_to_many.
  #
  # The following options can be supplied:
  # * *ALL types*:
  #   - :class - The associated class or its name. If not
  #     given, uses the association's name, which is camelized (and
  #     singularized if type is :{one,many}_to_many)
  #   - :eager - The associations to eagerly load when loading the associated object.
  #     For many_to_one associations, this is ignored unless this association is
  #     being eagerly loaded, as it doesn't save queries unless multiple objects
  #     can be loaded at once.
  # * :many_to_one:
  #   - :key - foreign_key in current model's table that references
  #     associated model's primary key, as a symbol.  Defaults to :"#{name}_id".
  # * :one_to_many:
  #   - :key - foreign key in associated model's table that references
  #     current model's primary key, as a symbol.  Defaults to
  #     :"#{self.name.underscore}_id".
  #   - :reciprocal - the string name of the instance variable of the reciprocal many_to_one association,
  #     if it exists.  By default, sequel will try to determine it by looking at the
  #     associated model's assocations for a many_to_one association that matches
  #     the current association's key.  Set to nil to not use a reciprocal.
  #   - :order - the column(s) by which to order the association dataset.  Can be a
  #     singular column or an array.
  # * :many_to_many:
  #   - :join_table - name of table that includes the foreign keys to both
  #     the current model and the associated model, as a symbol.  Defaults to the name
  #     of current model and name of associated model, pluralized,
  #     underscored, sorted, and joined with '_'.
  #   - :left_key - foreign key in join table that points to current model's
  #     primary key, as a symbol.
  #   - :right_key - foreign key in join table that points to associated
  #     model's primary key, as a symbol.
  #   - :select - the attributes to select.  Defaults to the associated class's
  #     table_name.*, which means it doesn't include the attributes from the join
  #     join table.  If you want to include the join table attributes, you can
  #     use this option, but beware that the join table attributes can clash with
  #     attributes from the model table, so you should alias any attributes that have
  #     the same name in both the join table and the associated table.
  #   - :order - the column(s) by which to order the association dataset. Can be a
  #     singular column or an array.
