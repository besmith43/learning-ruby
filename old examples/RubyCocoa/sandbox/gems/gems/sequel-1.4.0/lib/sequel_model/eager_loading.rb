# Eager loading makes it so that you can load all associated records for a
# set of objects in a single query, instead of a separate query for each object.
#
# The basic idea for how it works is that the dataset is first loaded normally.
# Then it goes through all associations that have been specified via .eager.
# It loads each of those associations separately, then associates them back
# to the original dataset via primary/foreign keys.  Due to the necessity of
# all objects being present, you need to use .all to use eager loading, as it
# can't work with .each.
#
# This implementation avoids the complexity of extracting an object graph out
# of a single dataset, by building the object graph out of multiple datasets,
# one for each association.  By using a separate dataset for each association,
# it avoids problems such as aliasing conflicts and creating cartesian product
# result sets if multiple *_to_many eager associations are requested.
#
# One limitation of using this method is that you cannot filter the dataset
# based on values of columns in an associated table, since the associations are loaded
# in separate queries.  To do that you need to load all associations in the
# same query, and extract an object graph from the results of that query.
#
# You can cascade the eager loading (loading associations' associations)
# with no limit to the depth of the cascades.  You do this by passing a hash to .eager
# with the keys being associations of the current model and values being
# associations of the model associated with the current model via the key.
#
# The associations' order, if defined, is respected.  You cannot eagerly load
# an association with a block argument, as the block argument is evaluated in
# terms of a specific instance of the model, and no specific instance exists
# when eagerly loading.
module Sequel::Model::Associations::EagerLoading
  # Add associations to the list of associations to eagerly load.
  # Associations can be a symbol or a hash with symbol keys (for cascaded
  # eager loading). Examples:
  #
  #  Album.eager(:artist).all
  #  Album.eager(:artist, :genre).all
  #  Album.eager(:artist).eager(:genre).all
  #  Artist.eager(:albums=>:tracks).all
  #  Artist.eager(:albums=>{:tracks=>:genre}).all
