* via RubyGems

  The simplest way of installing Ramaze is via 

    $ gem install ramaze

  in case you have RubyGems installed.


* via darcs

  To get the latest and sweetest, you can just pull from the repository and run
  Ramaze that way.

    $ darcs get --partial http://darcs.ramaze.net/ramaze

  Please read the man page or `darcs help` for more information about updating
  and creating your own patches.
  This is at the moment the premier way to use Ramaze, since it is the way I use
  it.

  Some hints for the usage of Darcs.

  * use require 'ramaze' from everywhere

    add a file to your site_ruby named 'ramaze.rb'
    the content should be: "require '/path/to/darcs/repo/ramaze/lib/ramaze'"

  * get the latest version (from inside the ramaze-directory)

    $ darcs pull

  * record a patch

    $ darcs record

  * output your patches into a bundle ready to be mailed (compress it before
    sending to make sure it arrives in the way you sent it)

    $ darcs send -o ramaze_bundle
    $ gzip -c ramaze_bundle > ramaze_bundle.gz


* via install.rb

  Support for install.rb has been canceled and the file removed.
