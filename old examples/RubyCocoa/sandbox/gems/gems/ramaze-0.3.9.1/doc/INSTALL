= Installating Ramaze

* via RubyGems

  The simplest way of installing Ramaze is via 

    $ gem install ramaze

  in case you have RubyGems installed.
  (this will work as soon as I have registered on RubyForge ;)

* via install.rb

  Ramaze provides a basic install.rb that should take care of the installation
  you can use it like 

    $ ruby install.rb

  you may need root-privileges to do
  that, depending on what options you provide.
  (please note that I haven't tested the install.rb extensively yet, so if you
  find some quirks, please send me patches or a simple note)

* via darcs

  To get the latest and sweetest, you can just pull from the repository and run
  Ramaze that way.

    $ darcs get --partial http://manveru.mine.nu/ramaze

  Please read the man page or `darcs help` for more information about updating
  and creating your own patches.
  This is at the moment the premier way to use Ramaze, since it is the way I use
  it.
