module Ramaze

  # A helper that provides the means to wrap actions of the controller with
  # other methods.
  #
  # For examples please look at the spec/ramaze/helper/aspect.rb
  #
  # This is not a default helper due to the possible performance-issues.
  # However, it should be only an overhead of about 6-8 calls, so if you
  # want this feature it shouldn't have too large impact ;)
  #
  # Like every other helper, you can use it in your controller with:
  #
  #   helper :aspect
