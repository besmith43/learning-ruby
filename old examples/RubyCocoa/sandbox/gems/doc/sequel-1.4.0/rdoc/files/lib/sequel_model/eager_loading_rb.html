      <p>
Eager loading makes it so that you can load all associated records for a
set of objects in a single query, instead of a separate query for each
object.
</p>
<p>
The basic idea for how it works is that the dataset is first loaded
normally. Then it goes through all associations that have been specified
via .eager. It loads each of those associations separately, then associates
them back to the original dataset via primary/foreign keys. Due to the
necessity of all objects being present, you need to use .all to use eager
loading, as it can&#8216;t work with .each.
</p>
<p>
This implementation avoids the complexity of extracting an object graph out
of a single dataset, by building the object graph out of multiple datasets,
one for each association. By using a separate dataset for each association,
it avoids problems such as aliasing conflicts and creating cartesian
product result sets if multiple *_to_many eager associations are requested.
</p>
<p>
One limitation of using this method is that you cannot filter the dataset
based on values of columns in an associated table, since the associations
are loaded in separate queries. To do that you need to load all
associations in the same query, and extract an object graph from the
results of that query.
</p>
<p>
You can cascade the eager loading (loading associations&#8217;
associations) with no limit to the depth of the cascades. You do this by
passing a hash to .eager with the keys being associations of the current
model and values being associations of the model associated with the
current model via the key.
</p>
<p>
The associations&#8217; order, if defined, is respected. You cannot eagerly
load an association with a block argument, as the block argument is
evaluated in terms of a specific instance of the model, and no specific
instance exists when eagerly loading.
