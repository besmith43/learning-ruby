- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Strict mode is usually used when giving the recorder to a known good algorithm. Strict mode captures the exact sequence of calls and validate that the code under test performs the exact same sequence of calls.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The recorder may exit strict mode via a <tt>should_be_strict(false)</tt> call. Non-strict expectations may be recorded at that point, or even explicit expectations (using <tt>should_receieve</tt>) can be specified.
