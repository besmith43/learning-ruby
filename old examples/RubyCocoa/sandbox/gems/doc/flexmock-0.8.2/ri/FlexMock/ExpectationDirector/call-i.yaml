  body: Invoke the expectations for a given set of arguments.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: First, look for an expectation that matches the arguements and is eligible to be called. Failing that, look for a expectation that matches the arguments (at this point it will be ineligible, but at least we will get a good failure message). Finally, check for expectations that don't have any argument matching criteria.
