      <h1><a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> 0.6.4 Released</h1>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> is a flexible mocking
library for use in unit testing and behavior specification in Ruby. Version
0.6.4 and 0.6.3 introduce several enhancements.
</p>
<h2>New in 0.6.4 (and 0.6.3)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added the flexmock(:model, &#8230;) method for better support when mocking
ActiveRecord objects. flexmock(:model, YourModelClass) will return a pure
mock object that responds to some basic ActiveRecord methods with
reasonable defaults.

</li>
<li>The flexmock() method now <em>always</em> returns a combination domain
object / mock object. This means the object return can handle domain
methods and mock-specific methods (such as should_receive and
mock_teardown).

</li>
<li>A side effect of always returning a domain/mock object is that partial
mocks are now enhanced with about 5 or 6 extra methods. Since partial mocks
are real objects with just a few methods mocked, there is a (small)
potential for a method name conflict. <a
href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> now supports a safe-mode
for partial mocks if this is an issue in particular case (see the RDoc
README file for more details).

</li>
<li>Fixed a small bug where attempting to mock a method that the partial mock
claims to respond to, but doesn&#8216;t actually have defined would cause
an error. This tended to happen on active record objects where attributes
are dynamically handled.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
NOTE: 0.6.4 improves the interface for mocking ActiveRecord model objects.
The flexmodel() method was too visually similar to flexmock() and was to
easy to get confused when reading code. Release 0.6.3&#8216;s flexmodel()
method has been removed and a new :model mode has been added to flexmock().
</p>
<h2>What is <a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a>?</h2>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> is a flexible
framework for creating mock object for testing. When running unit tests, it
is often desirable to use isolate the objects being tested from the
&quot;real world&quot; by having them interact with simplified test
objects. Sometimes these test objects simply return values when called,
other times they verify that certain methods were called with particular
arguments in a particular order.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> makes creating these
test objects easy.
</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy integration with both <a
href="../../../classes/Test/Unit.html">Test::Unit</a> and RSpec. Mocks
created with the flexmock method are automatically verified at the end of
the test or example.

</li>
<li>A fluent interface that allows mock behavior to be specified very easily.

</li>
<li>A &quot;record mode&quot; where an existing implementation can record its
interaction with a mock for later validation against a new implementation.

</li>
<li>Easy mocking of individual methods in existing, non-mock objects.

</li>
<li>The ability to cause classes to instantiate test instances (instead of real
instances) for the duration of a test.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
Suppose you had a Dog object that wagged a tail when it was happy.
Something like this:
</p>
<pre>
  class Dog
    def initialize(a_tail)
      @tail = a_tail
    end
    def happy
      @tail.wag
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
To test the <tt>Dog</tt> class without a real <tt>Tail</tt> object (perhaps
because real <tt>Tail</tt> objects activate servos in some robotic
equipment), you can do something like this:
</p>
<p>
require &#8216;test/unit&#8217; require &#8216;flexmock/test_unit&#8216;
</p>
<pre>
  class TestDog &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
    def test_dog_wags_tail_when_happy
      tail = flexmock(&quot;tail&quot;)
      tail.should_receive(:wag).once
      dog = Dog.new(tail)
      dog.happy
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> will automatically
verify that the mocked tail object received the message <tt>wag</tt>
exactly one time. If it doesn&#8216;t, the test will not pass.
</p>
<p>
See the <a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> documentation
at <a href="http://flexmock.rubyforge.org">flexmock.rubyforge.org</a> for
details on specifying arguments and return values on mocked methods, as
well as a simple technique for mocking tail objects when the Dog class
creates the tail objects directly.
</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>
You can make sure you have the latest version with a quick RubyGems
command:
</p>
<pre>
  gem install flexmock    (you may need root/admin privileges)
</pre>
<p>
Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:
