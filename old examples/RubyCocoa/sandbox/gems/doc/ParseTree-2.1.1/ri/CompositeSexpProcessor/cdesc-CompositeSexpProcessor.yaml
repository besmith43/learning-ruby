  body: Implements the Composite pattern on SexpProcessor. Need we say more?
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Yeah... probably. Implements a SexpProcessor of SexpProcessors so you can easily chain multiple to each other. At some stage we plan on having all of them run <tt>process</tt> and but only ever output something when <tt>generate</tt> is called, allowing for deferred final processing.
