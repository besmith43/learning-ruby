Feature: We can add new tasks
  As a busy developer with a lot of things to do
  I want to keep a list of tasks I need to work on

  Background:
    Given my terminal size is "80x24"
    And my home directory is in "/tmp"
    And an empty tasklist in "/tmp/todo.txt"

Scenario: Add a new task
  Given the file "/tmp/todo.txt" doesn't exist
  When I successfully run `todo.rb -f /tmp/todo.txt new 'Some new task'`
  And I successfully run `todo.rb -f /tmp/todo.txt list`
  Then the stdout should contain "Some new task"

  Scenario: The task list is in our home directory by default
    Given there is no task list in my home directory
    When I successfully run `todo.rb new 'Some new todo item'`
    Then the task list should exist in my home directory
    When I successfully run `todo.rb list`
    Then the stdout should contain "Some new todo item"
