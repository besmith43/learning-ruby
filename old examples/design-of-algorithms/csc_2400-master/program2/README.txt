Program Notes

1. It works perfectly on my Mac without any changes
2. For some reason, stoi it not in the standard library in Windows
3. The other timer did not work in Windows either; I used yours instead
4. There are four versions of the program, two for each one you wanted written
5. To compile. be sure you use C++11:
	
	g++ -std=c++11 -o <program_name> main.cpp
