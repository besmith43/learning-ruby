## Instructions for Running Ruby Program

Running Ruby scripts are identical to running Python Scripts

Simply run 'ruby main.rb' plus any commmand line arguments that are required.
For this program, the first argument is the file for the nodes, while the second is the list of edges.  The third is the starting node for the Dijkstra Search, and the fourth is the ending node for the Dijkstra Search.

I have included in the list of files, 2 run scripts.  One for the US cities, and the other for the Romanian ones.

There are no additional packages needed to run this program beyond the base ruby install.

If there any problems running this program, just email me at besmith43@students.tntech.edu
