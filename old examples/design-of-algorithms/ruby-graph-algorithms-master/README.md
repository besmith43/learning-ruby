# About

This is some of the code that I wrote while studying some famous graph
algorithms. Although each directory has a `README` file whith a brief
explanation, it's not my intend to fully explain any of these algorithms (there
are much better sources out there), I just want to show a way they can be
implemented in Ruby.

## Contributing

If you want to add some interesting algorithm, fix some bug or just improve my
code, fell free to open a pull request.

## License

Use this code as you want. If you do use it, a reference would be appreciated, but not required.
